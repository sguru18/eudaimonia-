# Eudaimonia! 🌱

A calm, modular personal lifestyle tracker built with Expo and React Native. I made this app during my gap semester to help me maintain certain lifestyle aspects I had built at home but not at school, and put it up on the App Store after my family asked about using it as well.

This app is also 100% AI-made, largely due to the fact that my prior experience with React Native gave me enough understanding to let AI handle most things without getting tripped up in the occasional errors. I like to come back to this app when new tools come out (like Google's Antigravity recently) to keep up with AI-aided development.

Check it out on the App Store!
